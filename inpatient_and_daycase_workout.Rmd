Can use this in shiny just filter it down by specialty

Can have both elective or emergency admissions show between the two graphs 

```{r}
activity_no_gj %>%  
  filter(hb %in% "Scotland",
         admission_type %in% "Emergency Inpatients") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = episodes, col = specialty_name)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

```{r}
activity_no_gj %>%  
  filter(hb %in% "Scotland",
         admission_type %in% "Emergency Inpatients",
         specialty_name %in% "General Medicine") %>% 
 # group_by(episodes) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = episodes, col = specialty_name)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```


```{r}
activity_no_gj %>%  
  filter(hb %in% "Scotland",
         admission_type %in% "Elective Inpatients") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = episodes, col = specialty_name)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```
Can 

This shows where 

```{r}
activity_no_gj %>%  
  filter(hb %in% "Scotland",
         specialty_name %in% "Intensive Care Medicine",
         admission_type != "All Inpatients and Day cases",
         admission_type != "Not Specified") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = episodes, col = admission_type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

       

### Admission by specialty

Better can shiny this one and pick the specialty_name

#### KPI: Do people have longer lengths of stay from elective or emergency admissions?

### KPI: The whole system: from whatâ€™s coming through the front door in A&E and then how it filters through; how many emergency admissions are there, how many electives, how does this impact the lengths of stay people have in hospital?

take out "All Inpatients and Day cases" & "Not Specified" as duplicating and not really any there

##### Episodes by Admission
```{r}
activity_no_gj %>%  
  filter(hb %in% "Scotland",
         specialty_name %in% "Infectious Diseases",
         admission_type %in% c("Elective Inpatients", 
                               "Emergency Inpatients", 
                               "Transfers")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = episodes, col = admission_type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

##### Spells by Admission
```{r}
activity_no_gj %>%  
  filter(hb %in% "Scotland",
         specialty_name %in% "Infectious Diseases",
         admission_type %in% c("Elective Inpatients",
